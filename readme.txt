To compile using the command line: javac Main.java
To run the program using: java Main Filename BS/FC 1/2/3 Gui-on/Gui-off
                      eg. java Main test.txt BS 1 Gui-off
BS represents for Backtrack search and FC represents for Forward-checking, 1/2/3 represent for different heuristics, 1 for random, 2 for most constrained node and 3 for most constraining node.
We have implemented the GUI of the puzzle, if you want to see how our solution works step by step you could use Gui-on, otherwise use Gui-off, but the gui will slow the run time.
